I did not have a chance to learn \r\n                    user experience or design thinking until I was onboarding on my \r\n                    first design job as an intern.\r\n                    <br/><br/>\r\n                    The transition from Taiwan to Thailand, and from business \r\n                    major to design digital products wasn't a smooth path. \r\n                    Luckily, I am a fast learner who is always curious about new \r\n                    technology and trends. I enjoy learning new things every day \r\n                    in the fast-changing industry, which is the most attractive \r\n                    part to me about design technology. I believe that a good \r\n                    design comes from the balance between user-centered motivation\r\n                     and business goals.\r\n                     <br/><br/>\r\n                    Outside of work, I am traveling, watching movies, Netflix, \r\n                    eating cake, and cooking.\r\n                    <br/><br/>\r\n                    --\r\n                    <br/><br/>\r\n                    You can follow me here -&nbsp;\r\n                    <Link \r\n                        href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/salie-chien/' \r\n                        target='_blank' \r\n                        rel='noopener'\r\n                        underline='none' \r\n                        className={classes.link}\r\n                    >\r\n                        LinkedIn\r\n                    </Link>,&nbsp;\r\n                    <Link \r\n                        href='https://saliejung.medium.com/' \r\n                        target='_blank' \r\n                        rel='noopener'\r\n                        underline='none' \r\n                        className={classes.link}\r\n                    >\r\n                        Medium\r\n                    </Link> \r\n                        &nbsp;and&nbsp;\r\n                    <Link \r\n                        href='https://github.com/saliejung' \r\n                        target='_blank' \r\n                        rel='noopener'\r\n                        underline='none' \r\n                        className={classes.link}\r\n                    >\r\n                        Github\r\n                    </Link>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    or reach out by email - saliejung47@gmail.com\r\n               </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            <div style={{marginTop:'5%'}}>\r\n                <Link \r\n                    underline='none' \r\n                    className={classes.link}\r\n                    target='_blank'\r\n                    href='./SalieChien_Resume.pdf'\r\n                >\r\n                    VIEW RESUME <OpenInNewIcon style={{fontSize:'inherit',marginBottom:'-0.2rem'}}/>\r\n                </Link>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div style={{marginTop:'8%'}}>\r\n                <img src={aboutme} style={{width:'100%'}}/>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n        </React.Fragment>\r\n    )\r\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
